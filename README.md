Implementation of a basic decentralized exchange as part of the SpeedRunEthereum challenges

This project is my implementation of the [DEX challenge](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/dex) from SpeedRunEthereum.  
It demonstrates the design and deployment of a basic decentralized exchange with liquidity pools and token swaps.

## Features
- Swap between ETH and ERC20 tokens
- Add/remove liquidity to the pool
- Track pool reserves
- Simple UI for interaction

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** (smart contracts)
- **Hardhat** (development & testing)
- **React + Next.js** (frontend)
- **Ethers.js** (contract interaction)
- **Scaffold-ETH** (boilerplate)
